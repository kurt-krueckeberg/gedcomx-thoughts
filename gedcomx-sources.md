# GECOM X

## Understand What is Gedcom X

[What is Gedcom X?](https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/gedcom-x) is the definitive introduction. It has helpful
links that will guide you to a better understanding of what Gedcom X and how it works.

The [Family Tree Data Model](https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/FamilyTree-data-objects) is intended to help programmers become
familiar with the data model of the FamilySearch Family Tree, which closely conform to the GedcomX [specification](http://www.gedcomx.org/Specifications.html).

The GEDCOM X [Conceptual Model](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md) is a
specification of formal concepts and types that are used to provide a standard model and vocabulary for describing genealogical data.
Genealogical data is structured by data types such as persons, relationships, and sources.

The [GEDCOM X JSON Serialization Format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/json-format-specification.md) specifies a JSON
media type for the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Highlighted JSON schema for each of the JSON objects can be see
at the GedcomX JSON [serialization format page](https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/gx_json). It also gives each object's properties, any superclasses
and interfaces are also given. 

The [GEDCOM X Java File Format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-java/blob/master/gedcomx-fileformat/README.md) provides support for reading and writing the
GEDCOM X File Format.
